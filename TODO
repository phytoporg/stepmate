Make a note somewhere, these were the instructions I followed to set this all up: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uswgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04

NEXT:
- Client can enumerate songs w/metadata
- Client can POST to add a song on the server
- Client can delete a song
- Server actually persists song data somewhere
- Response responds w/list of cached songs

DONE:
- Rename this project something sensible
- Get this up on github
- Add a client codepath, endpoints for exchanging info
- Server GET endpoint to enumerate cached songs

Getting the client to parse songs:
- Needs path to the stepmania songs directory
- Structure is:
-- <stepmania install root>/Songs/<Group>/<Song>
--- Then: the <Song>.sm file has song data. We'll just start with the artist for now.
