Make a note somewhere, these were the instructions I followed to set this all up: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uswgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04

Otherwise:
- Rename this project something sensible
- Get this up on github
- Add a client codepath, endpoints for exchanging info

Thinking:
- Server GET endpoint to enumerate cached songs
-- Response responds w/list of cached songs
- Client can POST to add a song
